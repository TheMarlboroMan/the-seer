	Alternativo para el viaje: se inicia con diapos de un memory totem.

A journey through the desert.
Mountains and forests.
Always Northward.
For many moons now I have walked [...]

	Este es para el viaje.
[...]
My name is [...]. I have travelled far from my homeland through the desert,
mountains and forests, always Northward. I have walked for many moons now, 
knowing that with every step I took the world was steadly erasing itself from
existance.

When I started my journey I was full with the strength of youth. Now the lines
of time are carved around my eyes.

[...]
My motivations have never been clear, but have always been passionate. Ever 
changing, I have pressed on for riches, fame, saving my world or saving myself.
I've told myself all sorts of stories. Almost with every change in the lands 
I've walked through, my mind has been changed about why am I supposed to be 
headed towards this place.

[...]
Fortunately all is clear now. The greatest treasure of them all: the legacy of
a line of brave navigators, collected through years of travelling every corner 
of the world.

[...]
ll this unvaluable legacy is not to be seen with the plain eye and can only be 
percieved during a small frame. 

The celestial bodies align now and as long as they're in sight, the fortress  
will appear. The legacy is within reach.

Like now, there wasn't much time. As soon as the alignment breaks the fortress
will be hidden again and everything inside will remain trapped.

Let us not waste an instant more.

	Sobre el viaje:

Aclarar el tema de que la existencia se borra: leyó que viajaría, y que nunca 
volvería.

Explicar como la naturaleza marcaba el camino siempre hacia el norte.

	Presentación del personaje

Call me [...]. In my language it means "He who talks to the stars".

As with all my people, the name that was given to me has come to determine who I
am and what I do.

During all my life I have learned to read the skies, observe the changes and 
predict the coming of stations and events. It is my gift to know how the moon
grows and shrinks in time, how the stars girate around the heaven's axis and 
when the wandering comets will come back.

	Algo sobre el origen del personaje.

In the beginning, we were people of the desert. Always on the run from sandstorms
and towards water sources. For us, water is life. Be it fallen from the sky
or dug from the ground, we worship it.

Back in the mist of time, divinations told of a place where no shortage of water
would ever befall, over the boiling sands and under blue skies. A place where my 
people could settle. 

According to our lore, the search took many generations, wandering the desert, 
talking to the stars, searching for the signs. It is said that one day, the
wanderers came upon a small tree, growing strong against bedrock, providing
fresh shade and exquisite fruit. From the cracks on the rock, small streams of
water would flow.

The tellers asked the skies, read the signs and with great joy, decided that
was the place where they would settle. Over the course of the centuries we built 
our city around that tree and water.

The name of our city is [...]. It means "Great home over the sand" and is a 
place of stone, [barro - adobe] and wood. Fresh gardens sing with water streams
and fountains, high walls keep the sand storms away and there are a thousand
[labradas] gates.

Outside the city, also surrounded by walls, we planted great extensions of land 
and irrigated them with the endless supply of water from the ground. Always 
surrounded by the desert, we learned to tame the land and keep the sands always 
one step away. In time, clouds and rain came during Spring.

	Sobre los totems de memoria.

It is said that when the first rain came, our first memory totem was risen with 
wood from the Original tree, decorated with the count of how many generations it 
took for [] to flourish. New markings were done each year to conmmemorate the
coming of the rains.

In time, a every single crossroad, garden and home a memory totem was risen, 
each telling the story of families or individuals. Libraries were built and
knowledge was preserved. [] persevered and grew, keeping count of the years and
sky talkers.

Still, many things were lost: the first memory totem dissapeared, names and
generations were forever lost and no totem or scroll is old enough to tell when 
did it happen. As far as we can know, that totem was lost at the beggining of 
time and we have lived in [] almost forever. 
 
	Sobre otras ciudades:

When the sun sets on [], the streets are light by oil lamps, hung across the 
buildings. [] can be seen from afar at night, so we learned to read the stars
from distant mountains and built roads towards them. Temples and observatories
rise now at the top. But as far as they rise, no other city is in sight: []
rises alone in what we know to be the center of the desert.

Our travellers and caravans have roamed the desert. We know just how large it
is and how many moons it takes to reach the edge. We are told of jungles,
mountains and forests that lay beyond it. Beyond them there's other people, with
their own strange temples, cities and stories. Over time, we tried to reach 
them.

But the desert is just too strong and everything is just too far.

(//TODO TODO TODO TODO//)

	Final erroneo.

An Ivory chest. Its surface polished to perfection, reflecting each little line
on my hands as I pry it open.

Reflecting every little gesture of anticipation for the wonders it contains.

Reflecting every little smirk of greed, as this is all now mine.

Reflecting every little trace of curiosity about what's inside, for this is what
we are.

The Cartographer. It all seems so clear now. For what else would be the legacy
of a line of navigators?.

Maps. In scrolls, rolls and thomes. Scribbled on cloth or etched in stone. 

Just maps. The currents and shores of this place and many others. The positions
of the stars through the years. The wisdom and patience of generations, forming
and image of unseen wonders that I just can't have, for they are too vast for
my hands to hold.

Just maps. I am seeing everything. I have nothing.

	Este es para entrar a "the crossings".

The colors, shapes and textures, sounds, elusive smells, cristalline tastes... 
It was as real as nowhere I had been before, as felt with new and heightened 
senses but still, at the same time, fragile and ethereal, promising to 
dissipate if I ever touched anything.

I pressed on.

	Este es para the labyrinth

Every single gate presented moving visions of me, shrouded in a dream like fog. 
I could see they were not real and felt that I would never be able to touch 
them, no matter how many times I would reach out for them, as if they were very 
far away.

At first I thought these were merely the images from my journey, presented to
me by some kind of magic. However, as I looked more intently I started to see
moments I did not remember: small misteps, seconds of undecision, decisions not 
made, paths not taken, a million untimely deaths, my own body decimated in 
every possible way, never finding a way out, dying of hunger, thirst and 
illness... [But also never leaving home, never reaching this place, a family
that was not my own, unfamiliar faces and places...]

And amongst them, the very steps that had led me to this place, right up to this
very point, each gesture and movement replicated in complete perfection. I
stared at all of them but every vision seemed to stare back at me when the act
of staring at them was reflected.

[and visions
that very well could be a [way out of here,] glimpse into my inmediate future.]

I pressed on.

	En medio de universal shores... Se podría sentar en la orilla o algo.

Endless blue ocean, as far as I could see. So calm, silent, bright and 
conforting that I could sit there forever, grasping the white sands and watching
them slip between my fingers just over, and over, and over.

To which were these the shores of?. Where did the breeze come from?. Were my 
eyes decieving me again?. As before, everything was vivid and present but I 
could not concieve how did these waters came to be here or how I came to rest 
beside them.

I can't relly tell how long it sat there, watching strange and wonderful clouds
pass by. All sense of urgency had already dissipated when I first set foot on 
the sand. It was a bright and clear day that did not seem to pass: [moreover] I
saw no trace of the sun but the light was coming from all over me.  

So familiar, yet strange and new... I could just figure that these shores were 
the only way to explain to me where or when I really was, as if something was 
speaking to my senses in words I could understand, trying to shield me from
a cold, black void I could never grasp with knowledge.

Freeing myself from these ideas I slowly stood up and shook the sand from my
clothes. I can remember it sparkling and slowly being carried away by the breeze
in meaningful patterns. Had I had the desire to do so, I am sure I could have
watched them forming in shapes that would tell the story of my life.

Still I pressed on.

	The machine [tal vez el final???. Falta una intro a la máquina]

	[El final???]

As soon as I glanced upon it, there was nothing else. 
No space. No time. Just me and the machine.
Wherever. Whenever.
We stare intently at each other. I can feel it. 
Everytime it glances upon me I realise that's all I've been doing.
Always and everywhere.
I have never been if not like this.

First I existed as a figure in someone's mind, exploring ancient ruins. I have 
been a place in the collective imagination. I have existed as lines in paper. 
I have not been but I have always been here, telling my story. I am information. 
I am as real to me as you are to yourself.

	Qué hay tras la playa???

1 - Una máquina
2 - La habitación del protagonista
3 - La misma habitación del inicio, en negativo

	Qué está pasando?

La puerta es una entidad pensante. Con las tabletas, el protagonista se comunica
con la misma. La puerta comunica sus respuestas por medio de los sentidos en una
forma comprensible.

El propósito de la puerta es de hacer de nexo entre diferentes realidades 
divergentes. La idea de las realidades va más allá: son planos de existencia,
como libros, dibujos o entretenimiento.

El protagonista ha elegido su existencia como un cúmulo de información,
contando su historia una y otra vez, a la espera de algo: "first I existed as
a figure in someone's mind, exploring ancient ruins. I have been a place in
the collective imagination. I have existed as lines in paper. I have not been 
but I have always been here, telling my story. I am information. I am as real to
me as you are to yourself.".

Todo esto hay que llevarlo a través del juego.
